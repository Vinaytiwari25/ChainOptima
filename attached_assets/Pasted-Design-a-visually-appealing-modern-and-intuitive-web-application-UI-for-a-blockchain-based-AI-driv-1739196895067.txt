Design a visually appealing, modern, and intuitive web application UI for a blockchain-based AI-driven resource allocation platform named "ChainOptima". The web app should have a futuristic, tech-inspired aesthetic with a sleek dark mode theme, neon blue & purple gradients, smooth animations, and a clean UI inspired by Fintech dashboards. The design should be user-friendly, responsive, and highly interactive.
