# ChainOptima ðŸš€  

AI-powered blockchain scalability and resource optimization using Layer 2 solutions.  

## ðŸ”¥ Overview  
Blockchain networks often face congestion, leading to high fees and slow transactions. **ChainOptima** integrates **AI/ML** to predict network congestion and dynamically allocate resources using **Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and Polygon**. This enhances blockchain scalability, reduces transaction costs, and optimizes validator node distribution.
